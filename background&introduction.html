<p align="justify">4 of us began to be friends since in the University. We are a good friends and after we have completed our Diploma in Information Management, Siti decided to open a food stall that provides various kind of foods which are delicious and affordable. Then, Siti asked us to join her business. All of us are really interested in managing business. Then, we figure out together to open our business and have our own stall. In 2019, we start to run our business together. All of us start from the scratch and many obstacles that we had faced together. Anyway, we are strong together and never lose our hope and our faith. Day by day, our customers began to increase because they said that our meals provided are very delicious and cannot compared to other stalls. Furthermore, our foods are affordable and reasonable because they are not expensive</p> 
<p align="justify">However, when our business has develop in a great way there are an unexpected situation happen which is the Covid-19. For the first Movement Control Phase, our stalls must be close and cannot be operate. We are very sad at that time and really hope that some miracles will happen. It is because, this business has helped us a lot in our life. We closed for about 2 months at that time and we find another job in order to earn a living. Alhamdulillah, in June 2020, we can open our stall as usual but we have set to open our business via online because we want to avoid the Covid-19 from spreading. Therefore, only deliveries and pick ups are prohibited and the deliveries are manage by our team.</p>
<p align="justify"> At first, we are quite confuse on how to do our sales through the online platform. But luckily, we are an Information Management students and we had learned about the Web Content Management & Design. We are really grateful at that time and everyone of us start to design the website together. We decorate and designs our website beautifully because we want our customers feel interested with our business and products. Praise to Allah, our online sales are increase and the customers are buying from us frequently, Our customers said that this is a simple method for them to buy a food because they just need to fill up the form and our team will deliver the foods for them. They does not have to go to the stalls and get the food because we have provide the delivery service for them. We hope that our business will become successful trough time.</p>
